## 🧠 Prediction Logic (Simplified)

- Accepts a **4-digit input** from the user.
- Generates a number from `0–9` using a custom formula.
- Converts the result into a **color category**:
  - `Green`: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  
  - `Red`: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8  
  - `Purple`: 0 or 5  
  - Combinations like **Green & Purple** and **Red & Purple** are derived based on overlapping rules.
